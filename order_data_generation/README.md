This folder contains files used to generate our csv files. 


## NR3D and SR3D
`nr3d_LLM_data_generation_step{1~4}.py` and `sr3d_data_generation.py` are used to generate referential-order-contained csv files.

## Subset generation
`extract_subset_percent.py` generates the subset of a given csv file. This is for training data subset generation.

## Order shuffling
`order_randomize.py` generates data with order shuffled. This is for ablation studies.
